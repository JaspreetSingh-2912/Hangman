Features: 
Word Selection: The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list of words or phrases. Players do not know the chosen word and must guess it letter by letter.
Visual Representation: The game typically includes a visual representation of a gallows, with a series of empty spaces representing each letter in the word. As incorrect guesses are made, parts of a stick figure (the "hangman") are drawn, typically starting with the gallows structure itself.
Guessing: Players guess individual letters of the word. Correct guesses fill in the corresponding spaces in the word, while incorrect guesses result in penalties such as adding parts to the hangman figure.
Limited Attempts: Players have a set number of incorrect guesses allowed before the hangman is completed, representing the end of the game.
Feedback: The game provides feedback on each guess, indicating whether the guessed letter is present in the word or not.
Game End: The game ends when the player successfully guesses the entire word, completing it without exceeding the maximum allowed incorrect guesses, or when the hangman figure is fully drawn.
Usage:

Starting the Game: Players initiate the game by selecting a category or theme, or simply by starting a new game.
Guessing: Players guess individual letters of the word by inputting them via keyboard or selecting them from an interface.
Visual Feedback: The game updates the visual representation of the hangman figure and the word as players make guesses.
Game Progress: Players continue making guesses until they either successfully guess the word, run out of allowed incorrect guesses, or choose to end the game.
Retry: Players can start a new game with a different word or category after the current game ends.
Objective:
The primary objective of Hangman is for players to successfully guess the hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. Players use deductive reasoning, knowledge of word patterns, and vocabulary skills to fill in the blanks and uncover the word before the hangman figure is fully drawn.

Conclusion:
Hangman offers a fun and challenging gaming experience suitable for players of all ages. With its simple rules, engaging gameplay, and emphasis on vocabulary and deduction, Hangman provides an entertaining way to pass the time while also exercising cognitive skills.
